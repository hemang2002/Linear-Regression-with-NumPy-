# Linear-Regression-with-NumPy-
Linear regression is a statistical method that allows you to learn a linear relationship between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable. In simpler terms, it helps you find a straight line that best fits your data. NumPy, a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, provides tools to perform this analysis effectively.
